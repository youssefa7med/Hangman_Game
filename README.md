# Hangman Game

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Features

- **Word Guessing**: Guess the letters of a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts.
- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **Visual Representation**: The game visually represents the hangman and updates it with each incorrect guess.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the player's guesses are valid (single letters that haven't been guessed before).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The game is developed using Python.
- **Random Module**: Used to randomly select the word to be guessed.
- **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals manage the game flow.
